- Functional:
  We have documented our containerized approach and the files needed to enable it.
  This artefact is consistent with the Modus  paper. It establishes its relevance by demonstrating that Modus does build Docker images --- the main point of Modus.
  The artifact is complete: it validates the key claims that justify that Modus is a suitable approach for parameterized build workflows.
  We have included a script that allows you to interactively select which results to generate; results are persisted in a directory after the container exits.

- Reusable:
  Our script generates a Docker image that conveniently contains all of the relevant packages and repositories.
  One could distribute just this image and use it as a development/research environment for experiments with Modus.

- Available:
  We have placed the artifact in a publicly accessible repository on GitHub: https://github.com/modus-continens/fse22-artifact.
