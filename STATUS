- Functional:
  We have documented our containerized approach and the files needed to enable it.
  We are consistent as this artifact demonstrates Modus building Docker images --- the main point of Modus.
  The artifact is complete as it validates the key claims needed to justify that Modus is a suitable approach for parameterized build workflows.
  We have included a script that allows you to interactively select which results to generate; results are persisted in a directory after the container exits.
- Reusable:
  The Docker image generated by our script is a convenient image containing all of the relevant packages and repositories.
  One could distribute just this image and use it as a developer/research environment for experiments with Modus.
- Available:
  We have placed the artifact on a publicly accessible repository on GitHub, https://github.com/modus-continens/fse22-artifact.
