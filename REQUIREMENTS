- Internet Connection, with a recommended bandwidth of at least 1 Gbps, to get similar results to the paper.
- A GNU/Linux Operating System, running on x86_64
- (Optional) The system could have 8 CPUs, 16 GiB RAM, 10 Gbps bandwidth, and an SSD disk with 8000 IOPS.
  - A good option would be a VM like AWS' `c5.2xlarge`.
- bash
- wget
- curl
- git
- Docker Engine
  - Furthermore, we assume sudoless docker is set up: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
  - To verify this, you should be able to run `docker run hello-world`.
