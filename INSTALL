Install `bash`, `wget`, `curl` and `git` using your operating system's package manager.

To install Docker:
- Follow the appropriate installation guide for Docker Engine based on your platform:
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server
- Follow the following guide to support running Docker as a non-root user.
  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

You should be able to run `docker run hello-world` if Docker is set up correctly.

This is sufficient to run our script, because our Dockerfile will `cargo install modus` when building the image.
This is why Docker in Docker is used for this artifact: Modus will run in a Docker container and build Docker images in an isolated Docker environment.
Follow the steps under `Reproducing the Main Results` in the README.md to continue.
